# YOLOv3-pytorch
Object detection is interesting and promising. In order to understand the mechanism of YOLO, I try to go through the building process of YOLOv3. The python code mostly based on [ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/tree/v6 )and [Ayoosh Kathuria](https://blog.paperspace.com/how-to-implement-a-yolo-v3-object-detector-from-scratch-in-pytorch-part-5/).
The purpose of this project is to train new dataset, such as balloon [dataset](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN/releases/download/v2.1/balloon_dataset.zip)
